## ex10.01
> The algorithm header defines a function named count that, like find, takes a 
> pair of iterators and a value. count returns a count of how often that value 
> appears. Read a sequence of ints into a vector and print the count of how 
> many elements have a given value.

[code](ex10_01.cpp)

## ex10.02
> Repeat the previous program, but read values into a list of strings.

[code](ex10_02.cpp)

## ex10.03
> Use accumulate to sum the elements in a vector<int>.
