> What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Parameters are local variables declared inside the function parameter lis.
Parameters are initialized by the arguments provided in each function call.

Arguments are values supplied in a function call that are used to initialize
the function's parameters.

Parameter: local variable declared inside the function parameter list;

local variable: variable defined inside a block;

local static variable: local variable whose value persists across calls to the
function. Local static variable that is created and initialized before control
reaches their use and is destroyed when the program ends.

```cpp
int func(int a){ // a is parameter
  static int n = 1; // n is local static variable

  for(int i = a; a > 0; --i){ // i is local variable
    n *= i;
  }
  return n;
} // func
```
